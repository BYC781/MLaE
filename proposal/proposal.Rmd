## Research Motivation

-   Under the pandemic, there were many inconveniences.
-   We try to figure out how working from home affect workers' well-being.
-   Our assumption is that working from home has negative impact on workers' well-being, since they might feel socially isolated.

## Literature
-   Marco Bertoni,Danilo Cavapozzi et al.*(2022), “Remote Working and Mental Health During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic”

## Data Source

IPUMS Time Use 2021

-   $D_i$: Distance working binary variable
-   $Y_i$: Well-being ladder (0-10)
-   $X_i$: Control variables, including statefip, age, gender, \# of kids, industry and occupation, earning per week, working hours, family income, \# of family members, class of worker, race.
-   \# of observations: 3,281,  \# of variables: 120

## Assumptions

-   We assume that unconfoundedness is satisfied, which is:
    $$(Y_{i(0)}, Y_{i(1)})\perp D_i|X_i$$
-   The sparsity assumption holds

# Model

## Run OLS

Consider the following model:

$$Y_i = \tau_{ols} D_{i} + X_{i}^T \boldsymbol{\beta} + \epsilon_{i}, \forall i=1,...,n$$ Where $\tau_{ols}, D_i$ are scalar, $X_i$ is a $k \times 1$ vector, $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a $k \times 1$ vector.

## Run DML

Given

$$\xi_0(X_i)=E(Y_i|X_i)$$ $$m_0(X_i)=E(D_i|X_i)=Pr(D_i=1|X_i)$$

We consider the following model: $$Y_i - \xi_0(X_i) = \tau_{dml} (D_i - m_0(X_i)) + u_i$$

-   First, we run Lasso (Y on X) to get $\hat\xi_0(X_i)$ and run Lasso (D on X) to get $\hat m_0(X_i)$
-   Second, we regress $Y_i - \hat\xi_0(X_i)$ on $(D_i - \hat m_0(X_i))$ to get $\hat\tau_{dml}$
-   $\hat\tau_{dml}$ is the treatment effect we want.

# Preliminary analysis

## Estimation Result: DDML

```

## Conclusion
-   It seems that working from home will reduce the distance workers' well-being.
-   We will further examine whether if distance workers' exercise time, sleep time and social time are significantly different to control group.
